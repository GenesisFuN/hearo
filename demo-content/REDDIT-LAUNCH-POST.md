# Reddit Launch Post - r/audiobooks

## Title

I built a free AI audiobook platform where anyone can turn their stories into full audiobooks

## Post Body

Hey r/audiobooks!

I've been working on something I think you'll find interesting. It's called **Hearo** (hearoaudio.com) - a completely free platform that lets anyone convert text into professional-quality audiobooks using AI narration.

### Why I Built This

I've always been an audiobook addict (currently on my 3rd re-listen of The Stormlight Archive), but I noticed a huge gap: there are millions of amazing stories online - fanfiction, web novels, short stories, indie books - that will never get audiobook versions because the cost is too high. Professional narration runs $200-400 per finished hour, which makes it impossible for most indie authors.

So I built Hearo to democratize audiobook creation.

### What Makes It Different

**For Listeners:**

- Free access to a growing library of AI-narrated audiobooks
- No subscription required
- Browse by genre (24 categories from Sci-Fi to Romance)
- Community-driven content

**For Creators:**

- Upload your text (book, story, manuscript)
- AI generates full narration automatically (using voice cloning tech)
- Publish publicly or keep private
- Free forever during beta

### The Tech

- Uses Coqui XTTS-v2 (open-source voice cloning model)
- Professional audio mastering pipeline
- Natural-sounding voices with proper pacing for audiobooks
- Processing takes ~2 hours for a typical novel

### Current Status

Just launched this week! Still in beta, so I'm actively looking for feedback from real audiobook listeners. The platform works, but I'm sure there are rough edges I haven't found yet.

**What I'd love feedback on:**

- Does the narration quality meet your standards?
- What features would make this more useful?
- Any bugs or UX issues?
- Would you actually use something like this?

### Try It Out

I've already published a demo book on the platform: [The Last Lighthouse Keeper](https://hearoaudio.com/public/books) - a short story perfect for testing (~15 min listen).

Main site: hearoaudio.com

**Full transparency:**

- This is completely free (no freemium model planned)
- I'm not collecting emails or selling data
- Open to feedback and feature requests
- Built this as a passion project, not a startup

Would love to hear what you think! Happy to answer any questions about the tech, the process, or the platform.

## Comment Response Templates

### If someone asks "How's the quality?"

"Honestly, it depends on what you're comparing it to. It's not Audible-level professional narration, but it's surprisingly natural - much better than old TTS voices. I'd say it's perfect for web novels, fanfiction, or content that wouldn't otherwise get audio versions. Give the demo a listen and let me know what you think!"

### If someone asks about cost

"Completely free right now during beta. No plans for premium tiers or paywalls. I want to see if people actually use it first before thinking about monetization."

### If someone asks about copyright

"Good question! Users agree to our Terms of Service before publishing, which includes certifying they own the rights to their content. We use OpenAI's moderation API to screen for prohibited content. But you're right - this is something I'm actively monitoring."

### If someone is skeptical

"Totally fair to be skeptical! That's why I'm posting here - I want real feedback from people who actually listen to audiobooks regularly. Try the demo and tell me what sucks. I'm here to improve it."

### If someone loves it

"That's awesome to hear! Would you mind sharing what worked well for you? I'm trying to understand what features matter most to real users."
