# Analytics Implementation Complete! 📊

## What We Built

A comprehensive analytics system for creators to track engagement, views, playback behavior, and audience insights.

## Files Created/Updated

### Database Schema

### Utilities

- ✅ **`src/lib/analytics.ts`** - Helper functions for tracking:
  - `trackView()` - Track book page views
  - `trackPlayStart()` - Track when playback starts

## How to Use

### 1. Run Database Migration

Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Copy/paste contents of docs/analytics-schema.sql
```

### 2. View Analytics Dashboard

Navigate to your **Creator Studio** and click the **Analytics tab**:

- Go to `localhost:3000/studio`
- Click "Analytics" 📈
- View real-time data!

Analytics is now fully integrated into your Studio dashboard.

### 3. Events Are Already Tracked! 🎉

All major events are now automatically tracked:

- **Views**: When someone visits a book page
- **Playback**: Start, progress (every 30s), and completion
- **Likes**: When someone likes a book
- **Comments**: When someone comments or replies

## API Usage

### Track an Event (Already integrated)

```typescript
POST /api/analytics/track
Body: {
  workId: "uuid",
  eventType: "view" | "play_start" | "play_progress" | "play_complete" | "like" | "comment" | "share",
  eventData: { /* optional */ }
}
```

### Get Analytics

```typescript
// Overall analytics
GET /api/analytics?days=30

// Per-work analytics
GET /api/analytics?workId=uuid&days=7
```

## Testing the Analytics System

### 1. Run the SQL Migration

Copy the contents of `docs/analytics-schema.sql` and run it in your Supabase SQL Editor.

### 2. Test Event Tracking

1. Visit a book page → View event tracked
2. Click play on a book → Play_start event tracked
3. Listen for 30+ seconds → Play_progress events tracked every 30s
4. Listen to 90%+ → Play_complete event tracked
5. Like a book → Like event tracked
6. Comment on a book → Comment event tracked

### 3. View Your Dashboard

Navigate to `/analytics` to see:

- Total views, likes, comments, followers
- Trend charts for the last 7/30/90 days
- Top performing books
- Recent activity feed
- Playback completion metrics

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities:

1. **Share Tracking** - Add share buttons with `trackShare()`
2. **Real-time Dashboard** - Use Supabase real-time subscriptions
3. **Export Analytics** - CSV/PDF export functionality

### Advanced Features:

1. **Email Reports** - Weekly/monthly analytics emails
2. **Comparative Analytics** - Compare with similar books
3. **Audience Demographics** - If you collect that data
4. **Peak Listening Times** - Show when your audience is most active
5. **Retention Metrics** - Track returning listeners
6. **Revenue Tracking** - If you add monetization
7. **A/B Testing** - Test different covers, descriptions, etc.

## Database Aggregation

The schema includes two aggregation functions that should be run daily:

```sql
-- Run via cron job or manually
SELECT aggregate_daily_stats(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day');
SELECT aggregate_follower_stats(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day');
```

These functions aggregate raw events into the `daily_stats` and `follower_stats` tables for fast querying.

You can set up a Supabase Edge Function or external cron job to run these daily.

## Performance Notes

- ✅ All tables have proper indexes on common query patterns
- ✅ Tracking calls are fire-and-forget (non-blocking)
- ✅ Daily aggregations cache computed metrics
- ✅ RLS policies enforce security at database level
- ✅ Anonymous tracking works for public books
- ✅ Progress tracking limited to every 30 seconds (not every second)

## Architecture Notes

### Event Flow:

1. User action (view, play, like, comment) → Frontend component
2. Frontend calls `trackEvent()` utility (fire-and-forget)
3. POST request to `/api/analytics/track` (non-blocking)
4. Event stored in `analytics_events` table
5. Aggregation functions roll up data daily into `daily_stats`
6. Dashboard queries `daily_stats` for fast performance

### Playback Session Flow:

1. User clicks play → `PlaybackSessionTracker` created
2. Tracker sends `play_start` event
3. Every 30 seconds of playback → `play_progress` event
4. At 90%+ completion → `play_complete` event
5. On pause/track change → tracker.stop()
6. Session data stored in `playback_sessions` table

### Security Model:

- **Public**: Anyone can track events (allows anonymous views/plays)
- **Creators**: Can only read analytics for their own works
- **Admin**: Service role can aggregate and manage all data

---

**Status:** ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED AND READY TO USE!

**What to do next:**

1. Run the SQL migration in Supabase
2. Test by visiting a book page, playing it, liking, and commenting
3. Navigate to `/analytics` to see your dashboard populate with data
4. Optionally set up daily aggregation cron jobs

🎉 Your analytics system is now tracking all major user engagement events automatically!
