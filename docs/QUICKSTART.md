## ⚠️ What's Left to Do (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Run Database Schema (5 minutes)

**You're currently viewing this file!** → `database-schema-complete.sql`

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and open your project
2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"New query"**
4. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `database-schema-complete.sql`
5. Paste and click **Run**
6. Wait for green checkmark ✅

This creates:

- `profiles` table (user accounts)
- `creator_profiles` table (creator info)
- `works` table (audiobooks)
- `uploads` table (upload tracking)
- `audio_files` table (generated audio)
- `subscriptions` table (billing)
- `voice_samples` table (voice cloning)
- Plus 8 more tables + RLS policies + triggers

### Step 2: Test Authentication (10 minutes)

1. **Start your Next.js dev server:**

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create a test account:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/signup`
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Username: `testuser`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Type: **Creator**
   - Click "Sign Up"

3. **Verify in Supabase:**
   - Go to Supabase → **Authentication** → **Users**
   - You should see your new user!
   - Go to **Table Editor** → **profiles**
   - You should see the profile row (auto-created by trigger!)

4. **Test the dashboard:**
   - Should automatically redirect to `/dashboard`
   - Should show your email, username, and account type
   - Should show "Creator Dashboard" with upload options

5. **Test logout and login:**
   - Click logout in navbar
   - Go to `/login`
   - Enter same credentials
   - Should work!

### Step 3: Update Upload Routes (15 minutes)

Your upload routes need to save to the database. Update these files:

**File: `src/app/api/upload/text/route.ts`**

Add after successful upload:

```typescript
// Save to database
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);

// Get user from auth
const authorization = request.headers.get("Authorization");
const token = authorization?.replace("Bearer ", "");
const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.getUser(token);

if (user) {
  await supabase.from("uploads").insert({
    id: uploadId,
    user_id: user.id,
    type: "text",
    status: "completed",
    file_path: textFilePath,
    original_filename: file.name,
  });
}
```

- ✅ Login/signup pages
- ✅ User dashboard (listener vs creator views)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to Supabase"

- Check `.env.local` has correct URL and keys
- Restart Next.js dev server

### "User not found after signup"

- Make sure you ran the database schema SQL
- Check Supabase → Authentication → Users
- Check Supabase → Table Editor → profiles

### "Profile not created"

- Schema includes trigger to auto-create profiles
- Check if trigger exists: Supabase → Database → Triggers
- Look for `on_auth_user_created` trigger

### "RLS policies blocking access"

- Policies are configured to use `auth.uid()`
- Make sure user is logged in
- Check Authorization header is being sent

---

## 🎉 You're Almost There!

**Just run the SQL schema and test authentication!**

Total time remaining: ~30 minutes

After that, you'll have a fully functional authentication system with database persistence. Everything else is just adding features on top of this solid foundation.
