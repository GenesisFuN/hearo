# Social Engagement System - Implementation Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Been Built

### Database (Supabase)

- ✅ `book_likes` table with RLS policies
- ✅ `book_comments` table with nested replies support
- ✅ `book_ratings` table (1-5 stars)
- ✅ 5 new columns on `works` table: likes_count, comments_count, average_rating, ratings_count, views_count
- ✅ Automatic count updates via database triggers
- ✅ Security with Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### API Endpoints (All Created)

- ✅ `POST/GET /api/books/[id]/like` - Toggle like/get status
- ✅ `GET/POST /api/books/[id]/comments` - Get/create comments
- ✅ `PATCH/DELETE /api/books/[id]/comments/[commentId]` - Edit/delete comments
- ✅ `POST/GET/DELETE /api/books/[id]/rate` - Rate/get rating/remove rating
- ✅ `POST /api/books/[id]/view` - Track views/plays

### Frontend Components

- ✅ `BookEngagement` component - Reusable engagement UI
  - Like button with heart icon
  - Star rating (interactive)
  - Comments count
  - Views count
  - Auto-detects authentication
  - Size variants (sm, md, lg)
- ✅ Integrated into `BookLibrary` component
- ✅ View tracking on play

### API Updates

- ✅ `/api/books` now includes engagement data in response

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Database Setup (Already Done!)

The SQL script ran successfully and created:

- 3 tables: book_likes (3 policies), book_comments (4 policies), book_ratings (4 policies)
- 5 new columns on works table
- 3 trigger functions for automatic count updates

### 2. Test the Endpoints

#### Option A: Browser Console

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Sign in to your app
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Copy and run the test script:

```javascript
// Copy contents of test-engagement.js
```

#### Option B: Manual Testing

```bash
# Get your auth token from browser localStorage
# Then test with curl:

# Like a book
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/books/YOUR_BOOK_ID/like \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Rate a book (1-5 stars)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/books/YOUR_BOOK_ID/rate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rating": 5}'

# Comment on a book
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/books/YOUR_BOOK_ID/comments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"commentText": "Amazing audiobook!"}'
```

### 3. See It in Action

1. Upload a book (or use existing one)
2. Publish it (Share button)
3. You'll now see engagement stats below the book:
   ```
   ❤️ 0  💬 0  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ —  👁️ 0
   ```
4. Click the heart to like
5. Click stars to rate
6. Play the book to track a view

## 🎨 UI Components

### BookEngagement Component

```tsx
<BookEngagement
  bookId="book-uuid"
  initialLikes={0}
  initialComments={0}
  initialRating={0}
  initialRatingsCount={0}
  initialViews={0}
  size="md" // sm, md, or lg
  showComments={false} // optional
/>
```

**Features:**

- Interactive like button (heart fills red when liked)
- 5-star rating (hover to preview, click to rate)
- Shows average rating and count
- View counter
- Auto-refreshes on user action
- Requires authentication (prompts if not signed in)

## 📊 Data Structure

### Book Object (Updated)

```typescript
interface Book {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  // ... existing fields
  likes?: number; // NEW
  comments?: number; // NEW
  averageRating?: number; // NEW (0.0-5.0)
  ratingsCount?: number; // NEW
  views?: number; // NEW
}
```

### API Response

```json
{
  "id": "book-uuid",
  "title": "My Book",
  "likes": 42,
  "comments": 15,
  "averageRating": 4.5,
  "ratingsCount": 20,
  "views": 1337
}
```

## 🔥 What This Enables

### 1. Trending Algorithm

```sql
-- Most popular books
SELECT * FROM works
WHERE is_public = true
ORDER BY
  (likes_count * 1.0 +
   comments_count * 2.0 +
   (average_rating / 5) * ratings_count * 3.0 +
   views_count * 0.1) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Recommendation Engine

- Users who liked this also liked...
- High-rated books in same genre
- Trending in your interests

### 3. Creator Payouts

```typescript
const engagementScore =
  likes * 1.0 +
  comments * 2.0 +
  (averageRating / 5) * ratings * 3.0 +
  views * 0.1;
const creatorShare = (creatorScore / totalScore) * payoutPool;
```

### 4. Social Features

- Most commented books
- Highest rated this week
- Most viewed today
- Community favorites

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate

1. **Test the endpoints** - Use browser console or curl
2. **Verify in Supabase** - Check data in tables
3. **Like/rate some books** - See UI in action

### Short Term

1. **Comments UI** - Full comments section with replies
2. **Public books page** - Show engagement on community books
3. **Trending page** - Sort by engagement score

### Long Term

1. **Recommendation system** - ML-based suggestions
2. **Creator analytics** - Dashboard with stats
3. **Payout system** - Fair compensation based on engagement
4. **Social profiles** - User pages with activity feed
5. **Notifications** - When someone likes/comments

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ Only public books can be engaged with
- ✅ Users can't like/rate their own books (optional enforcement)

## 🎊 Success Metrics

Track these in Supabase:

```sql
-- Total engagement
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_likes FROM book_likes;
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_comments FROM book_comments;
SELECT
  AVG(rating) as average_all_ratings FROM book_ratings;

-- Most engaged book
SELECT
  w.title,
  w.likes_count,
  w.comments_count,
  w.average_rating,
  w.views_count
FROM works w
WHERE is_public = true
ORDER BY (likes_count + comments_count + views_count) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
