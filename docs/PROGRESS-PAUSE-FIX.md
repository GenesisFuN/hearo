# Progress Tracking - Pause/Resume Fix

## Issue

The progress tracker's auto-save interval continued running even when audio was paused, causing unnecessary saves and console logs every 10 seconds.

## Root Cause

The `setInterval` was started when the ProgressTracker was created (on first play) and only stopped when the tracker was destroyed (on track change). This meant it kept firing even during pauses.

## Solution

Added `pause()` and `resume()` methods to the ProgressTracker class:

### ProgressTracker Changes

```typescript
class ProgressTracker {
  /**
   * Pause auto-save (when playback is paused)
   * - Stops the interval to prevent unnecessary saves
   * - Saves current position one last time before pausing
   */
  pause() {
    if (this.saveInterval) {
      clearInterval(this.saveInterval);
      this.saveInterval = null;
    }

    // Save current position before pausing
    if (this.pendingProgress) {
      this.save(this.pendingProgress.current, this.pendingProgress.duration);
    }
  }

  /**
   * Resume auto-save (when playback resumes)
   * - Restarts the interval if it was stopped
   */
  resume() {
    if (!this.saveInterval) {
      this.startAutoSave();
    }
  }
}
```

### AudioPlayer Integration

```typescript
// In the play/pause effect
if (isPlaying && audio.paused) {
  // Should be playing but audio is paused
  audio.play();

  // Start or resume progress tracking
  if (!progressTrackerRef.current && currentTrack.id) {
    progressTrackerRef.current = new ProgressTracker(currentTrack.id);
  } else if (progressTrackerRef.current) {
    progressTrackerRef.current.resume(); // ✅ Resume interval
  }
} else if (!isPlaying && !audio.paused) {
  // Should be paused but audio is playing
  audio.pause();

  // Pause the progress tracker
  if (progressTrackerRef.current) {
    progressTrackerRef.current.pause(); // ✅ Stop interval
  }
}
```

## Behavior

### Before Fix

1. User plays audio → Tracker created, interval starts
2. User pauses → **Interval keeps running** ❌
3. Every 10s: "Interval triggered, saving..." (even while paused)
4. Unnecessary network calls and console spam

### After Fix

1. User plays audio → Tracker created, interval starts
2. User pauses → **Interval stops, saves current position** ✅
3. While paused: No interval activity, no saves
4. User resumes → Interval restarts
5. Clean console, efficient saves

## Benefits

✅ **No unnecessary saves** - Only saves while actually playing  
✅ **Better battery life** - No timers running during pause  
✅ **Cleaner console** - No log spam while paused  
✅ **Saves on pause** - Current position saved immediately when pausing  
✅ **Seamless resume** - Interval restarts when playback resumes

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Basic Pause/Resume

1. Play a book for 15 seconds
2. Pause
3. Wait 30 seconds (paused)
4. Resume playing
5. ✅ Only 1 save during playback, 1 on pause, none during pause period

### Test Case 2: Multiple Pause/Resume Cycles

1. Play → Pause → Play → Pause → Play
2. ✅ Interval stops and starts correctly each time
3. ✅ No duplicate saves or missed saves

### Test Case 3: Pause Near Save Interval

1. Play for 9 seconds (just before 10s save)
2. Pause
3. ✅ Current position (9s) saved immediately on pause
4. ✅ No save at 10s mark (interval stopped)
