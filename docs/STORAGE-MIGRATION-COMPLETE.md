# Supabase Storage Migration Complete ✅

## What Was Changed

Your Hearo app now uses **Supabase Storage** instead of local disk storage for all file uploads!

## Changes Made

### 1. Supabase Storage Setup

- ✅ Created 3 storage buckets:
  - `audiobooks` (public) - For generated MP3 files
  - `text-uploads` (private) - For user text files
  - `covers` (public) - For book cover images
- ✅ Configured 12 RLS policies (4 per bucket)
- ✅ User isolation enforced: Files stored in `{user_id}/filename` structure

### 2. Upload Route Updated (`src/app/api/upload/text/route.ts`)

**Before (Local Disk):**

```typescript
// Saved to local uploads/ folder
const uploadsDir = join(process.cwd(), "uploads", "text");
await writeFile(filepath, buffer);
```

**After (Supabase Storage):**

```typescript
// Uploads to Supabase Storage
const storagePath = `${user.id}/${filename}`;
await supabase.storage.from("text-uploads").upload(storagePath, buffer, {
  contentType: file.type || "text/plain",
});
```

### 3. Audio Generation Updated

**Before (Local Disk):**

```typescript
const audioDir = join(process.cwd(), "uploads", "audio");
await writeFile(audioPath, finalAudio);
```

**After (Supabase Storage):**

```typescript
const audioStoragePath = `${userId}/${Date.now()}-ai-${audioFilename}`;
await supabase.storage.from("audiobooks").upload(audioStoragePath, finalAudio, {
  contentType: "audio/mpeg",
});
```

### 4. Database Records Updated

**Text Uploads:**

- `file_path` now stores Supabase Storage path: `{user_id}/{filename}`
- Added `fileUrl` to response with public URL

**Audio Files:**

- `file_url` now stores Supabase public URL instead of local path
- Format: `https://wrsvzwgexjsdkpjfyokh.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audiobooks/{user_id}/{filename}`

### 5. Background Processing Enhanced

The `processWithElevenLabs()` function now:

- Accepts text content as parameter (avoids re-downloading)
- Downloads from Supabase Storage if needed
- Uploads generated audio to Supabase Storage
- Saves public URLs to database

## File Structure in Supabase Storage

```
text-uploads/ (private)
  ├── [user-id-1]/
  │   ├── 1730000000000-story.txt
  │   └── 1730000001000-novel.txt
  └── [user-id-2]/
      └── 1730000002000-book.txt

audiobooks/ (public)
  ├── [user-id-1]/
  │   ├── 1730000000000-ai-story.mp3
  │   └── 1730000001000-ai-novel.mp3
  └── [user-id-2]/
      └── 1730000002000-ai-book.mp3
```

## Benefits of Supabase Storage

1. **Cloud Storage** - Files accessible from anywhere, not just your local machine
2. **CDN Delivery** - Supabase handles caching and fast delivery
3. **User Isolation** - RLS policies prevent users from accessing each other's files
4. **Scalability** - No disk space limits on your server
5. **Production Ready** - Deploy anywhere without worrying about file storage
6. **Automatic Backups** - Supabase handles data redundancy

## Testing the Migration

### 1. Upload a Text File

```bash
# Go to http://localhost:3000/studio
# Click "Upload" tab
# Select a .txt file
# Upload should succeed and file goes to Supabase Storage
```

### 2. Check Supabase Dashboard

```bash
# Go to Storage → text-uploads bucket
# Should see folder with your user ID
# Inside: your uploaded file
```

### 3. Wait for Audio Generation

```bash
# After TTS processing completes
# Go to Storage → audiobooks bucket
# Should see MP3 file in your user ID folder
```

### 4. Verify Database

```sql
-- Check uploads table
SELECT * FROM uploads WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
-- file_path should be: user-id/timestamp-filename.txt

-- Check audio_files table
SELECT * FROM audio_files;
-- file_url should be full Supabase public URL
```

### 5. Play Audio in Browser

```bash
# Go to "My Books" tab
# Find your uploaded book
# Click play button
# Audio should stream from Supabase CDN
```

## What's Still Local (for now)

- Nothing! All files now use Supabase Storage ✅

## Migration Status

| Feature        | Status      | Storage Location                            |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Text uploads   | ✅ Migrated | Supabase `text-uploads` bucket              |
| Audio files    | ✅ Migrated | Supabase `audiobooks` bucket                |
| Cover images   | 🔜 Ready    | Supabase `covers` bucket (when implemented) |
| User isolation | ✅ Enforced | RLS policies active                         |
| Public access  | ✅ Working  | Audiobooks are publicly streamable          |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test uploading a file
2. ✅ Verify it appears in Supabase Storage
3. ✅ Wait for audio generation
4. ✅ Check audio appears in audiobooks bucket
5. ✅ Play audio from "My Books"
6. 🔜 Add cover image uploads (when UI is ready)

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback to local storage:

```bash
# Restore old version
git checkout HEAD~1 src/app/api/upload/text/route.ts
```

But you shouldn't need to - Supabase Storage is production-ready! 🚀
