# Progress Bars on Book Cards - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Added visual progress indicators to all book cards throughout the app. Users can now see at a glance how much of each audiobook they've listened to without having to open the book or check Continue Listening.

## Implementation Date

October 20, 2025

## Component Created

### BookProgressBar (`src/components/BookProgressBar.tsx`)

**Features:**

- Fetches playback progress for a given book ID
- Only renders when progress > 0% (invisible for new books)
- Thin horizontal bar with accent color
- Smooth width transition animation
- Positioned absolutely at bottom of book cover
- Uses existing `getProgress()` function from progress.ts

**Props:**

- `bookId: string` - The book ID to fetch progress for
- `className?: string` - Optional additional CSS classes

**Behavior:**

- Returns `null` if loading or progress is 0%
- Shows progress from 0-100% with smooth transitions
- Automatically updates when progress changes

## Integration Points

### 1. Discover Page (`src/app/discover/page.tsx`)

**Added progress bars to:**

- ‚úÖ **Search Results** - Grid of books matching search query
- ‚úÖ **Trending Books** - Horizontal carousel with rank badges
- ‚úÖ **Recent Books** - Horizontal carousel of latest releases

**Implementation:**

```tsx
<BookProgressBar
  bookId={book.originalId || book.id}
  className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0"
/>
```

**Positioning:** Absolutely positioned at bottom of cover image, overlays the image

### 2. Library Page (`src/app/library/page.tsx`)

**Added progress bars to:**

- ‚úÖ **Saved Books Tab** - Grid of user's saved audiobooks
- ‚úÖ **Following Tab** - Grid of books from followed creators

**Implementation:**

```tsx
<BookProgressBar
  bookId={book.id}
  className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0"
/>
```

**Note:** Continue Listening cards already had progress bars built-in

### 3. Profile Page (`src/app/profile/[username]/page.tsx`)

**Added progress bars to:**

- ‚úÖ **Creator's Published Books** - Grid showing all books by a creator

**Implementation:**

```tsx
<BookProgressBar
  bookId={book.id}
  className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0"
/>
```

### 4. Public Books Page (`src/app/public/books/page.tsx`)

**Added progress bars to:**

- ‚úÖ **Genre Carousels** - Horizontal scrolling books grouped by genre

**Implementation:**

```tsx
<BookProgressBar
  bookId={book.originalId || book.id}
  className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0"
/>
```

## Visual Design

### Progress Bar Styling

- **Height:** 1px (thin, subtle)
- **Background:** `bg-surface/60` (semi-transparent surface color)
- **Fill Color:** `bg-accent` (matches app theme)
- **Position:** Absolute bottom of book cover
- **Width:** Full width of cover (100%)
- **Transition:** Smooth 300ms animation on width changes

### UX Benefits

- **At-a-glance progress** - See progress without clicking
- **Visual continuity** - Matches Continue Listening card design
- **Non-intrusive** - Only shows when there's progress
- **Brand consistent** - Uses accent color theme
- **Responsive** - Works on all card sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Progress Fetching

Uses existing `getProgress()` function from `src/lib/progress.ts`:

- Checks authentication status
- Queries `playback_sessions` table for authenticated users
- Falls back to localStorage for anonymous users
- Returns progress data with `completionPercentage`

### Performance Considerations

- Component only fetches progress once on mount
- Returns `null` early if no progress (no DOM rendering)
- Uses existing progress infrastructure (no new API calls)
- Progress updates happen naturally through playback system

### Loading State

- Shows nothing while loading (loading = true)
- Shows nothing if progress is 0%
- Prevents flash of empty bar during initial load

## Files Modified

1. **Created:**
   - `src/components/BookProgressBar.tsx` - New component

2. **Updated:**
   - `src/app/discover/page.tsx` - Added to search, trending, recent
   - `src/app/library/page.tsx` - Added to saved books & following tabs
   - `src/app/profile/[username]/page.tsx` - Added to creator's books grid
