# Auto-Resume Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Implemented automatic resume functionality across the entire app. When users click play on any book they've already started listening to, it will automatically resume from where they left off without showing a confirmation dialog.

## Changes Made

### 1. PlayerContext (`src/contexts/PlayerContext.tsx`)

- **Import**: Added `getProgress` from `../lib/progress`
- **Updated `playTrack` function**: Now async and automatically fetches saved progress
  - If `track.startTime` is undefined, fetches progress from database
  - If progress > 30 seconds, automatically sets `track.startTime` to resume position
  - This happens centrally for ALL play button clicks across the app

### 2. AudioPlayer (`src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx`)

- **Added `hasAutoSeekedRef`**: Prevents infinite loop when seeking to startTime
- **Updated track loading logic**:
  - When `currentTrack.startTime` is provided, sets `savedProgress` and `showResumePrompt(false)`
  - This bypasses the resume confirmation dialog
- **Updated `handleCanPlay`**:
  - Checks `hasAutoSeekedRef` to ensure seek only happens once
  - Auto-seeks to `currentTrack.startTime` when audio is ready
  - Resets flag when new track loads

### 3. Book Detail Page (`src/app/public/book/[id]/page.tsx`)

- **Import**: Added `useBookProgress` hook
- **Added progress check**: `const { hasProgress } = useBookProgress(id as string)`
- **Updated button text**:
  - Shows "Playing..." when currently playing
  - Shows "Resume" when book has saved progress
  - Shows "Play Audiobook" for new books

### 4. Continue Listening Card (`src/components/ContinueListeningCard.tsx`)

- **Updated button UI**:
  - Changed from circular icon-only button to pill-shaped button with text
  - Now displays play icon + "Resume" text
  - Better communicates that clicking will resume playback

### 5. New Hook (`src/hooks/useBookProgress.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Check if a book has saved progress
- **Returns**: `{ hasProgress, loading }`
- **Usage**: Allows components to show "Resume" vs "Play" text

## How It Works

### Auto-Resume Flow:

1. User clicks play button anywhere in the app
2. `playTrack()` is called with track info
3. `playTrack()` checks if `startTime` is already provided
4. If not, fetches saved progress from database/localStorage
5. If progress > 30 seconds, sets `track.startTime` to that position
6. AudioPlayer receives track with `startTime`
7. AudioPlayer sets `showResumePrompt(false)` (no dialog)
8. When audio loads (`canplay`), automatically seeks to `startTime`
9. Playback begins from saved position

### Button Text Logic:

- **Book Detail Page**: Uses `useBookProgress` hook to check for saved progress
  - "Resume" if `hasProgress` is true
  - "Play Audiobook" if false
  - "Playing..." if currently active

- **Continue Listening**: Always shows "Resume" (only shows books with progress)

- **Other locations**: Just play automatically (no text change needed)

## Files Modified

1. `src/contexts/PlayerContext.tsx` - Auto-fetch progress in playTrack
2. `src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx` - Auto-seek and skip resume prompt
3. `src/app/public/book/[id]/page.tsx` - Show "Resume" text
4. `src/components/ContinueListeningCard.tsx` - Show "Resume" button
5. `src/hooks/useBookProgress.ts` - NEW: Hook to check for saved progress

## Benefits

- ✅ Seamless UX - no interrupting dialogs
- ✅ Consistent behavior across entire app
- ✅ Clear visual feedback (Resume vs Play)
- ✅ Works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- ✅ Prevents infinite seek loops with ref flag
- ✅ Centralized logic in PlayerContext (single source of truth)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Play book from Discover page with saved progress → auto-resumes
- [ ] Play book from Book Detail page → shows "Resume" text and auto-resumes
- [ ] Click Continue Listening card → shows "Resume" button and auto-resumes
- [ ] Play new book (no progress) → starts from beginning, shows "Play"
- [ ] Verify no "Resume from X:XX?" dialog appears
- [ ] Check progress continues tracking after resume
- [ ] Test with multiple books in Continue Listening

## Future Enhancements

- Could add "Resume" text to Discover page card hover buttons
- Could add progress indicator to all book cards (not just Continue Listening)
- Could show time remaining on all play buttons
