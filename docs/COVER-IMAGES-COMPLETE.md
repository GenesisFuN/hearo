# Cover Image Display Updates - Full Resolution

## Changes Made

Updated all book display components to show covers in proper 2:3 aspect ratio (matching recommended 800x1200px uploads).

### Updated Components

#### 1. **Individual Book Page** (`/public/book/[id]`)

**Before:** 192x192px square
**After:** 256x384px (2:3 ratio) - `w-64 h-96`

```tsx
<div className="w-64 h-96 ... overflow-hidden shadow-xl">
  <img src={book.coverImage} className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
</div>
```

**Display:** Large hero cover that properly shows the full book cover design

---

#### 2. **Library Page - My Library Tab**

**Before:** Square aspect ratio
**After:** 2:3 aspect ratio with `aspect-[2/3]`

```tsx
<div className="w-full aspect-[2/3] ... overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
  <img src={book.coverImage} className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
</div>
```

**Display:** Responsive width, maintains 2:3 ratio (looks like real book covers)

---

#### 3. **Library Page - Following Tab**

**Before:** Square aspect ratio  
**After:** 2:3 aspect ratio with `aspect-[2/3]`

Same styling as My Library tab for consistency.

---

#### 4. **Profile Page** (`/profile/[username]`)

**Before:** Square aspect ratio
**After:** 2:3 aspect ratio with `aspect-[2/3]`

```tsx
<div className="w-full aspect-[2/3] ... overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
  <img src={book.coverImage} className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
</div>
```

**Display:** 4-column grid on large screens, each showing proper book cover proportions

## Why 2:3 Aspect Ratio?

### Recommended Upload Size: 800x1200px (2:3 ratio)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Matches actual book cover proportions
- ✅ Shows more of the cover design (not cropped to square)
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Standard for audiobook platforms
- ✅ Better use of uploaded 800x1200 images

### Display Sizes

| Location        | Container      | Approximate Display           |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Individual Book | `w-64 h-96`    | 256x384px                     |
| Library Grid    | `aspect-[2/3]` | ~200x300px (responsive)       |
| Profile Grid    | `aspect-[2/3]` | ~180x270px (responsive)       |
| Discover Cards  | Square         | 192x192px (horizontal scroll) |
| Public Books    | Square         | 192x192px (horizontal scroll) |

### Why Some Stay Square?

**Horizontal scrolling carousels** (Discover, Public Books) use square for:

- Consistent card height in horizontal layout
- Easier to scan when scrolling
- Fits more books on screen

**Vertical grids** (Library, Profile, Individual) use 2:3 for:

- Better showcase of cover art
- More realistic book appearance
- Takes advantage of vertical space

## Image Optimization
