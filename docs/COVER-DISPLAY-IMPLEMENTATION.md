# Cover Image Display - Implementation Complete

## Changes Made

Fixed cover images to display in the UI by updating the API to read from the correct database column.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/app/api/books/route.ts`

**Fixed column name mismatch:**

```typescript
// Before
coverImage: work.cover_image_url; // ❌ Wrong column name

// After
coverImage: work.cover_image; // ✅ Correct column name
```

#### 2. `src/components/BookLibrary.tsx`

**Added cover image display to book cards:**

```tsx
{
  book.coverImage ? (
    <img
      src={book.coverImage}
      alt={`${book.title} cover`}
      className="w-16 h-16 object-cover rounded-lg border border-surface"
    />
  ) : (
    <div className="w-16 h-16 bg-surface/50 rounded-lg">
      {/* Fallback icon */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Where Covers Are Displayed

### 1. **Studio → My Books**

- ✅ Shows cover thumbnail (64x64px) on each book card
- ✅ Falls back to status icon if no cover
- ✅ Rounded corners with border

### 2. **Edit Book Modal**

- ✅ Shows full preview (128x192px) when uploading
- ✅ Shows current cover when editing
- ✅ Updates preview when new image selected

## How It Works

### Upload Flow

1. User clicks "Edit" on book in Studio
2. Clicks "Upload Cover" button
3. Selects image file (max 5MB, JPG/PNG/WebP)
4. Preview appears immediately (local file)
5. On "Save Changes":
   - Uploads to `covers` bucket
   - Gets public URL
   - Saves URL to `works.cover_image` column
   - Updates local state

### Display Flow

1. API fetches books: `SELECT * FROM works`
2. Reads `cover_image` column value
3. Maps to `coverImage` property
4. Component renders:
   ```tsx
   <img src={book.coverImage} alt="..." />
   ```

## Column Name History

**Why the confusion?**

- Original code expected: `cover_image_url`
- Migration created: `cover_image`
- Update API used: `cover_image` ✅
- Fetch API used: `cover_image_url` ❌ (now fixed)

**Solution:**
Standardized on `cover_image` everywhere to match the database column.

## Testing Checklist
