# Saved Books / Library Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Refactored the Library page from showing "My Books" (creator's own books) to "Saved Books" (books users save/like from across the platform). Studio already has a "My Books" section, so this avoids duplication.

## Implementation Date

October 19, 2025

## Database Setup

### Table: `saved_books`

**File:** `docs/saved-books-schema.sql`

**Schema:**

```sql
saved_books (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID (FK to auth.users),
  work_id UUID (FK to works),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, work_id)
)
```

**RLS Policies:**

- Users can view their own saved books
- Users can save books (INSERT)
- Users can unsave books (DELETE)

**Indexes:**

- `idx_saved_books_user_id` - Fast user queries
- `idx_saved_books_work_id` - Fast book lookups
- `idx_saved_books_created_at` - Sort by recently saved

---

## API Endpoints Created

### 1. GET `/api/library`

**Purpose:** Fetch all saved books for authenticated user

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "books": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "title": "Book Title",
      "artist": "Narrator Name",
      "coverImage": "https://...",
      "genre": "Fiction",
      "publishedAt": "2025-10-19",
      "savedAt": "2025-10-19",
      "audioPath": "/api/public/audio/uuid"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. POST `/api/library/save`

**Purpose:** Save a book to library

**Body:** `{ "bookId": "uuid" }`

**Returns:** `{ "message": "Book saved successfully", "saved": true }`

**Features:**

- Checks if book exists
- Handles duplicate saves gracefully (UNIQUE constraint)
- Returns success even if already saved

### 3. DELETE `/api/library/unsave`

**Purpose:** Remove a book from library

**Body:** `{ "bookId": "uuid" }`

**Returns:** `{ "message": "Book removed from library", "saved": false }`

### 4. GET `/api/library/is-saved/[id]`

**Purpose:** Check if a specific book is saved

**Returns:** `{ "saved": boolean }`

**Features:**

- Returns `false` if not authenticated (no error)
- Used by SaveBookButton to show correct state

---

## Components Created

### SaveBookButton Component

**File:** `src/components/SaveBookButton.tsx`

**Props:**

- `bookId: string` - Book to save/unsave
- `size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg"` - Button size (default: "md")
- `showLabel?: boolean` - Show "Saved"/"Save" text (default: false)

**Features:**

- Auto-checks saved status on mount
- Toggles between ‚ù§Ô∏è (saved) and ü§ç (not saved)
- Loading states (‚è≥ spinner)
- Hover scale animation
- Color changes: accent when saved, neutral when not
- Toast-style feedback

**Usage:**

```tsx
<SaveBookButton bookId={book.id} size="md" showLabel={false} />
```

## Library Page Refactoring

### Old Structure:

- üìö My Library (user's created books)
- üë• Following
- üéµ Playlists

### New Structure:

- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Saved Books** (books user has saved)
- üë• Following
- üéµ Playlists

**Continue Listening** section appears above tabs (unchanged).

### Changes Made:

1. Renamed tab from "My Library" to "Saved Books"
2. Changed `myBooks` state to `savedBooks`
3. Updated `fetchMyBooks()` to `fetchSavedBooks()`
4. Calls `/api/library` instead of `/api/books`
5. Updated empty state messaging
6. Changed icon from üìö to ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Empty State:

```
‚ù§Ô∏è
No Saved Books Yet
Save audiobooks you love to access them quickly from your library
[Discover Books]
```

---

## Next Steps

### TODO: Add Save Buttons to Pages

Need to add `<SaveBookButton>` component to:

1. **Discover Page** (`src/app/discover/page.tsx`)
   - Add to each book card (top-right corner)
2. **Public Books Page** (`src/app/public/books/page.tsx`)
   - Add to each book card
3. **Individual Book Page** (`src/app/public/book/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Add next to play button in hero section
4. **Profile Page** (`src/app/profile/[username]/page.tsx`)
   - Add to each book in user's published books grid

### TODO: Database Migration

**Run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard:**

```sql
-- See: docs/saved-books-schema.sql
CREATE TABLE saved_books (...);
-- Plus indexes and RLS policies
```

## User Flow

### Saving a Book:

1. User browses Discover/Public Books
2. Sees ü§ç (heart) button on book card
3. Clicks to save ‚Üí Button shows ‚è≥ loading
4. Book saved ‚Üí Button changes to ‚ù§Ô∏è (filled heart)
5. Book appears in Library ‚Üí Saved Books tab

### Unsaving a Book:

1. User clicks ‚ù§Ô∏è button on a saved book
2. Button shows loading state
3. Book removed ‚Üí Button changes to ü§ç
4. Book disappears from Library

### Accessing Saved Books:

1. Click "Library" in navigation
2. Default tab is "Saved Books"
3. Grid of saved books (same layout as Following)
4. Can play, add to playlist, etc.

## Design Decisions

### Why Separate from "My Books"?

- Studio already has "My Books" for creators
- Library is for **consuming** content, not creating
- Matches user expectations (like Spotify, Audible)
- Clearer separation of roles: Creator vs. Listener

### Why Heart Icon (‚ù§Ô∏è)?

- Universal symbol for "like" or "save"
- Familiar to users from other platforms
- Emotional connection to content
- Clear visual feedback (filled vs. outline)

### Why UNIQUE Constraint?

- Prevents duplicate saves
- No need for "already saved" error messages
- Idempotent API (multiple saves = same result)
- Cleaner database

---

## Testing Checklist

### Database:

- [ ] Run `saved-books-schema.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work (can't see other users' saves)
- [ ] Test UNIQUE constraint (can't save twice)

### API:

- [ ] POST `/api/library/save` - saves book
- [ ] POST duplicate save - returns success, no error
- [ ] DELETE `/api/library/unsave` - removes book
- [ ] GET `/api/library` - returns saved books
- [ ] GET `/api/library/is-saved/[id]` - checks status

### UI:

- [ ] SaveBookButton shows correct initial state
- [ ] Click to save - button updates to ‚ù§Ô∏è
- [ ] Click to unsave - button updates to ü§ç
- [ ] Loading states work
- [ ] Book appears in Library after saving
- [ ] Book disappears from Library after unsaving
- [ ] Continue Listening still works above tabs

### Integration:

- [ ] Add SaveBookButton to Discover page
- [ ] Add SaveBookButton to Public Books page
- [ ] Add SaveBookButton to Individual Book page
- [ ] Add SaveBookButton to Profile pages

## Performance Considerations

- Queries use proper indexes for fast lookups
- RLS policies filter at database level
- Button checks saved status once on mount (cached)
- No real-time updates (refresh to see changes)
- Efficient joins in saved books query

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time updates when saving/unsaving
- [ ] "Saved on [date]" timestamps in Library
- [ ] Sort saved books (recent, alphabetical, etc.)
- [ ] Collections/folders for saved books
- [ ] Share your saved books list
- [ ] "Recommended based on saves" feature
- [ ] Export saved books list
- [ ] Bulk operations (unsave multiple)
