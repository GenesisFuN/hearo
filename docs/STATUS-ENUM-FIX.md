# Work Status Enum Fix - Complete

## Problem

The code was using `status = 'complete'` but the Supabase database enum `work_status` only accepts:

- `'draft'`
- `'processing'`
- `'published'`

This caused uploads to get stuck at 95% progress because the final status update failed silently.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Cleanup

Run this SQL in Supabase to remove stuck uploads and fix the published one:

```sql
-- Delete stuck processing uploads
DELETE FROM works
WHERE title ILIKE '%glass%forest%'
  AND status = 'processing'
  AND progress_percent = 0;

-- Verify Glass Forest is published with 100% progress
UPDATE works
SET status = 'published', progress_percent = 100
WHERE id = '41235630-5e66-4028-b82e-7440e106a195';
```

### 2. Code Changes

#### Backend (API Routes)

- `src/app/api/upload/text/route.ts`: Changed all `status: "complete"` to `status: "published"`
- `src/app/api/books/route.ts`: Changed progress calculation to check for `"published"` instead of `"complete"`

#### Frontend (Components)

- `src/components/BookLibrary.tsx`:
  - Updated status type: `"draft" | "processing" | "published" | "failed"`
  - Changed all status checks from `"complete"` to `"published"`
  - Updated playAudio, downloadAudio, and filter logic
- `src/components/UploadManager.tsx`:
  - Updated status type: `"draft" | "processing" | "published" | "failed"`
  - Changed status mappings: `"uploading"` → `"draft"`, `"complete"` → `"published"`
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`:
  - Updated Book interface status type to match database enum

### 3. Valid Status Values

According to the database enum `work_status`:

- ✅ `'draft'` - Initial upload state
- ✅ `'processing'` - TTS generation in progress
- ✅ `'published'` - Complete and ready to play
- ❌ `'complete'` - INVALID (was causing the bug)
- ❌ `'error'` - Not in database (use 'failed' instead)

## What This Fixes

1. ✅ Uploads will now complete properly at 100%
2. ✅ Books will show play/download buttons when published
3. ✅ Status updates won't fail silently
4. ✅ Type safety matches actual database schema
5. ✅ Cleaned up stuck Glass Forest uploads

## Next Steps

After applying these changes:

1. Run the cleanup SQL in Supabase
2. Refresh your app
3. Glass Forest should show as "Published" with play/delete options
4. Test a new upload end-to-end to verify 0% → 100% works
