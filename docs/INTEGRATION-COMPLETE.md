# ‚úÖ Database Integration Complete!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. User Authentication

- ‚úÖ Signup/login working with Supabase Auth
- ‚úÖ Email confirmation disabled for development
- ‚úÖ Profile creation trigger working with RLS bypass
- ‚úÖ Users properly isolated with `creator_id`

### 2. API Routes Updated

#### `/api/books` (GET) - List User's Books

**Before:** Read from file system (all users saw all files)  
**After:** Query database with RLS filtering by `creator_id`

```typescript
// Now queries: works table + audio_files join
// RLS automatically filters to current user's works only
```

#### `/api/upload/text` (POST) - Upload Text File

**Before:** Only saved file to disk  
**After:** Saves to database + disk

```typescript
1. Authenticate user
2. Save file to /uploads/text/
3. Insert into works table (creator_id = user.id)
4. Insert into uploads table
5. Start AI processing in background
6. When audio complete:
   - Insert into audio_files table
   - Update works.status to 'complete'
```

### 3. Database Tables Used

**`profiles`** - User accounts

- `id` (UUID, references auth.users)
- `username`, `display_name`
- `user_type` (listener | creator)
- `subscription_tier` (free | basic | premium | creator)

**`works`** - Audiobooks/content

- `id` (UUID primary key)
- `title`, `description`
- `creator_id` (UUID, references profiles.id) ‚Üê **This enforces user isolation**
- `status` (draft | processing | complete | failed)
- `is_public` (boolean)

**`uploads`** - Upload records

- `id` (UUID)
- `work_id` (references works.id)
- `user_id` (references profiles.id)
- `file_name`, `file_path`, `file_size`
- `upload_type` (text | audio | voice_sample)

**`audio_files`** - Generated audio

- `id` (UUID)
- `work_id` (references works.id)
- `file_name`, `file_url`
- `format` (mp3), `status` (complete)
- `duration` (optional)

### 4. RLS (Row Level Security) Policies

All tables have policies that ensure:

```sql
-- Users can only see their own works
USING (creator_id = auth.uid() OR is_public = true)

-- Users can only insert works as themselves
WITH CHECK (creator_id = auth.uid())

-- Users can only update/delete their own works
USING (creator_id = auth.uid())
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Upload as User 1

1. Sign in as User 1
2. Go to `/studio` ‚Üí Upload
3. Upload a text file (e.g., "Story.txt")
4. Wait for AI processing
5. Go to "My Books" ‚Üí Should see 1 book

### Test 2: Upload as User 2

1. Sign out
2. Sign in as User 2 (different email)
3. Go to `/studio` ‚Üí Upload
4. Upload a different text file (e.g., "Novel.txt")
5. Go to "My Books" ‚Üí Should see ONLY User 2's book (not User 1's)

### Test 3: Verify Isolation

1. Sign in as User 1 again
2. Go to "My Books" ‚Üí Should see ONLY User 1's books
3. User 2's books should NOT appear

## What Happens Now

**Upload Flow:**

```
User uploads text file
    ‚Üì
API authenticates user
    ‚Üì
File saved to disk: /uploads/text/{timestamp}-{filename}
    ‚Üì
Database record created:
  - works table (creator_id = user.id, status = 'processing')
  - uploads table (user_id = user.id)
    ‚Üì
AI processing starts in background
    ‚Üì
Audio generated and saved to: /uploads/audio/{timestamp}-ai-{filename}.mp3
    ‚Üì
Database updated:
  - audio_files table (work_id = work.id)
  - works.status updated to 'complete'
    ‚Üì
User refreshes "My Books" ‚Üí sees completed audiobook
```

**List Books Flow:**

```
User requests /api/books
    ‚Üì
API authenticates user
    ‚Üì
Database query:
  SELECT * FROM works
  WHERE creator_id = current_user.id
  JOIN audio_files ON works.id = audio_files.work_id
    ‚Üì
RLS policies automatically filter results
    ‚Üì
Only user's own books returned
    ‚Üì
UI displays books
```

## Database Schema Status

‚úÖ **All tables created with RLS enabled**
‚úÖ **Triggers working (profile creation)**
‚úÖ **Policies active (user isolation)**
‚úÖ **Foreign keys enforcing relationships**
‚úÖ **Indexes for performance**

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Authentication working
2. ‚úÖ User isolation working
3. ‚úÖ Upload saves to database
4. ‚úÖ Books properly filtered by user

**Optional enhancements:**

- Add book cover images
- Add categories/genres
- Add public/private toggle in UI
- Add book search/filter
- Add analytics (view counts, etc.)

---

**Status:** üéâ **WORKING!** Users are now properly isolated and can only see their own books!
