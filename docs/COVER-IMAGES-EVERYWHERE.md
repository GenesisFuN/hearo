# Cover Images Display - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Cover images now display everywhere books are shown across the entire application, including in the audio player.

2. **`/api/public/book/[id]`** - Individual book view
3. **`/api/profile/[username]`** - User profile books

## Data Flow

### Upload ‚Üí Display

```
1. User uploads cover in EditBookModal
2. Image saved to "covers" bucket
3. Public URL stored in works.cover_image column
4. API reads work.cover_image
5. API returns { coverImage: work.cover_image }
6. UI displays book.coverImage
```

### Example Data

```json
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "title": "My Book",
  "coverImage": "https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/covers/[id]_[timestamp].jpg",
  "audioPath": "...",
  "genre": "Fantasy"
}
```

- No lazy loading implemented yet

### Future Optimizations

- [ ] Implement Next.js `<Image>` component for optimization
- [ ] Add lazy loading for off-screen images
- [ ] Generate thumbnails at upload time (64x64, 192x192, 512x512)
- [ ] Use responsive image srcset
- [ ] Add blur placeholder while loading
