## Database

The `book_comments` table was created via `docs/social-engagement-schema.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS book_comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  work_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES works(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  comment_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_comment_id UUID REFERENCES book_comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

  CONSTRAINT comment_text_length CHECK (char_length(comment_text) >= 1 AND char_length(comment_text) <= 1000)
);
```

**RLS Policies:**

- Anyone can view comments (SELECT)
- Authenticated users can create comments (INSERT)
- Users can only edit/delete their own comments (UPDATE/DELETE)

**Triggers:**

- Automatically updates `comments_count` on the `works` table
