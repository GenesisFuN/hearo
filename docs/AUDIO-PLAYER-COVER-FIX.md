# Audio Player Cover Image Display

## Issue

The audio player at the bottom of the page was showing a generic disc icon instead of the book's cover image.

## Fix Applied

### File: `src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx`

**Before:**

```tsx
<div className="w-12 h-12 bg-surface rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
  <div className="relative">{/* Generic disc icon - always shown */}</div>
</div>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<div className="w-12 h-12 bg-surface rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
  {hasValidSource && currentTrack.cover ? (
    <img
      src={currentTrack.cover}
      alt={currentTrack.title}
      className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    />
  ) : (
    <div className="relative">{/* Generic disc icon - fallback */}</div>
  )}
</div>
```

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. User clicks play on a book
2. `playTrack()` is called with book data including `cover: book.coverImage`
3. `currentTrack` is updated in PlayerContext
4. AudioPlayer reads `currentTrack.cover`
5. If cover exists → Display image
6. If no cover → Show disc icon fallback

### Display Specs

- **Size:** 48x48px (w-12 h-12)
- **Shape:** Rounded (rounded-lg)
- **Fit:** object-cover (fills square)
- **Container:** overflow-hidden (clean edges)

## Testing

**Play any book** and check:

- ✅ Cover appears in bottom player (48x48px)
- ✅ Matches the book you're playing
- ✅ Updates when switching books
- ✅ Shows disc icon if no cover

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Result:** Audio player now displays book covers!
