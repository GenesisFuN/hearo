# Cover Images - Complete Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

Updated **all** locations where books are displayed to show cover images instead of placeholder emojis.

## Files Changed

### API Routes (5 routes fixed)

All now read from `cover_image` column:

1. âœ… `/api/public/books` - Public books listing
2. âœ… `/api/public/book/[id]` - Individual book view
3. âœ… `/api/profile/[username]` - User profile books
4. âœ… `/api/feed/following` - Following feed
5. âœ… `/api/playlists/[id]` - Playlist items

### UI Components (6 pages/components updated)

1. âœ… **Discover Page** - Trending & Recent books sections
2. âœ… **Public Books Page** - All genre sections
3. âœ… **Individual Book Page** - Large hero cover
4. âœ… **Studio (My Books)** - Already had covers
5. âœ… **Library Page** - Already had covers in both tabs
6. âœ… **Profile Page** - Already had covers in books grid

### Player Integration (3 files updated)

Updated `playTrack()` calls to pass cover images:

1. âœ… **public/book/[id]** - Now uses `book.coverImage`
2. âœ… **discover** - Now uses `book.coverImage`
3. âœ… **library, profile, playlist** - Already using coverImage

## How It Works

### Data Flow

```
Upload:
EditBookModal â†’ Supabase Storage â†’ works.cover_image column

Display:
Database â†’ API (cover_image) â†’ UI (coverImage) â†’ <img>

Player:
Book click â†’ playTrack({ cover: book.coverImage }) â†’ AudioPlayer
```

### Fallback Behavior

```tsx
{
  book.coverImage ? (
    <img
      src={book.coverImage}
      alt={book.title}
      className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    />
  ) : (
    "ðŸŽ§" // or status icon
  );
}
```

## Testing

2. âœ… See cover in Studio (My Books) - 64x64 thumbnail
3. âœ… See cover in Library (My Library) - full grid
4. âœ… Publish book
5. âœ… See cover in Discover page - trending/recent
6. âœ… See cover in Public Books - genre sections
